For Lint

functions that need to be added code are :


comments : class_Var_decs & subr_decs (complete) 


warnings : ast_statement & var_dec


errors: ast_constructor, ast_function or ast_method



    ann a = get_ann(t);
    a = add_ann_warnings(a, "Unused");

//////
trying to figure out the warnings for lint.cpp , can't seem to test the condition where they output.


///////
tried feeding in the annotations in copy_var_decs() but it is still not outputting at all. Still very confused
on where the annotations for var_decs() comes.


/////
tried to replace the original return t in copy_var_dec to this :

return create_var_dec(b, name, segment, offset, type);

but it conflicts with the above functions and break the first test case of annotation comments
